# Readme Document Creator

# USER STORY
as a user I want to have a high quality readme but I want to skip the time and hassle it takes to  create one manually. I want an applicaton to do it for me based off my inputs

# Functionality / About the project
The app takes in user inputs for the tile, user story, functionality, and links to add, using inquierer command line prompts. Then the application uses FS to write the users inputs using string interpolation into the readme file
